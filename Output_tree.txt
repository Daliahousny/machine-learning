From the accuracy graph: 
When the amount of training data is small, an ML model does not generalise well. This is usually because the model is overfitting, 
In general, model overfitting is reduced as the training dataset size increases, More data will almost always increase the accuracy of a model, 
However, that does not necessarily mean that spending resources to increase the training dataset size is the best way to affect the model’s predictive performance. 
 
From the graph of average nodes of tree size: 
Decision trees are very interpretable – as long as they are short. The number of terminal nodes increases quickly
